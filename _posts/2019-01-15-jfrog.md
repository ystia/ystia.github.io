___TL;DR: JFrog & Google offer a [GCP cloud-hosted, fully-featured Artifactory Pro instance](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/saas-gcp/) to open-source projects.___

As an open-source community we need efficient collaboration tools to develop high quality softwares.
Fortunately, these days, some companies sponsor open source projects by offering access to their services free of charge.
Ystia uses [GitHub](https://github.com) for hosting source code and this web site, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) for continuous integration, [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) for agile project management, [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) for hosting documentation.

But today we want to focus on [JFrog](https://jfrog.com) products.

A year ago we open sourced Ystia Orchestrator (Yorc) and Ystia Forge.
We chose Travis CI to build our development and release artifacts. But Travis is not designed to store build artifacts.
By looking for a way to store these artifacts we found that JFrog offers [Bintray](https://bintray.com) account free of charge for open source projects.
Creating a Bintray account is as simple as signing in with GitHub and importing your project or organization from GitHub.

So, for a year or so we used Bintray to store our CI build artifacts. As Bintray is designed to serve release artifacts we experienced some
difficulties. After our second time being rate-limited due to disk quota overuse (mainly due to the number docker images we built),
JFrog guys got in touch with us with good news: they offer [Artifactory Pro](https://jfrog.com/artifactory) accounts hosted on GCP for selected open source projects.

While we knew Artifactory and were convinced that it is one of the best solution around to manage artifacts, we didn't consider it yet for two reasons. First we needed to manage Docker images artifacts, which are not supported on the open source version of Artifactory. And secondly, as an open source community we do not have infrastructures to host such products in a community-open way.

We didn't hear about this program, so JFrog email sounded just like a christmas gift in this 20th of december!

We filled-up [the application form](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/saas-gcp/) and few minutes after doing this an instance was live on GCP.
This is now our official artifacts repository. As per our process to be as open as possible this instance is accessible in read-only anonymously:
<https://ystia.jfrog.io/ystia/webapp/>.

We are still in the process to discover all the functionalities offered by Artifactory, like release management with automatic push to Bintray,
build promotion and so on. But there is no doubt that Artifactory is a great solution for artifact management!

So a big thanks to you JFrog and Google for supporting our open source developments!
